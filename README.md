# Spinning Wheel Game

A Python-based spinning wheel game that allows you to input a list of names, spin the wheel, and land on a random name. The selected name is removed from the pool until all names have been chosen, ensuring fairness. Once all names are selected, the pool is reset automatically.

## Features

- **Customizable Name List**: Add any number of names to the wheel by modifying the list in the script.
- **Fair Selection**: Names are not repeated until all names have been selected.
- **Colorful Segments**: The wheel is divided into vibrant segments, each displaying a name.
- **Interactive Spinning**: Spin the wheel with a simple keypress and enjoy a smooth slowing animation.
- **Random Landing**: Each spin is completely random, ensuring unbiased results.

## Customization

### Name List

You can edit the list of names directly in the script. Locate the `ALL_NAMES` variable in the code and replace the default names with your desired list.

Example:
```python
ALL_NAMES = [
    "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Hannah",
    "Isaac", "Jack", "Karen", "Liam", "Mia", "Nina", "Oscar", "Paul",
    "Quinn", "Rachel", "Steve", "Tina", "Uma", "Victor", "Wendy", "Xander", "Zoe"
]
```

You can add as many names as you like, but the visual appearance might get cramped if too many names are added.

### Segment Colors

The colors of the wheel segments can be customized by modifying the `COLORS` list in the script. Colors are defined as RGB tuples.

Default colors:
```python
COLORS = [
    (255, 69, 0),    # OrangeRed
    (30, 144, 255),  # DodgerBlue
    (34, 139, 34),   # ForestGreen
    (255, 215, 0),   # Gold
    (238, 130, 238), # Violet
    (106, 90, 205),  # SlateBlue
    (255, 105, 180), # HotPink
    (72, 61, 139),   # DarkSlateBlue
]
```

Add or modify the colors as desired.

### Spin Speed and Friction

Adjust the initial speed and friction of the spinning wheel to change how it behaves.

- **Spin Speed**: Modify the `random.uniform(10, 15)` function in the script to change the initial spin speed range.
- **Friction**: Adjust the `SPIN_DECAY` value (default is `0.98`) to control how quickly the wheel slows down. A value closer to `1.0` makes the wheel spin longer.

---

## Example Name List

The default name list includes 25 entries:
```
Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Hannah, Isaac, Jack, Karen,
Liam, Mia, Nina, Oscar, Paul, Quinn, Rachel, Steve, Tina, Uma, Victor,
Wendy, Xander, Zoe
```

You can replace this with any names of your choice.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements you can add to the game:

- Save the list of winners to a file.
- Add sound effects for spinning and winner announcements.
- Allow customization of the wheel size, font, and segment spacing.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to input names directly.
